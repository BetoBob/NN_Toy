# Resources

I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/dn9s0h/is_there_a_resource_that_shows_every_little_step/) in search of a way to understand Neural Networks. Here are some resources I'm looking into to better understand Neural Networks.

## Books

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen
  * this was recommended by 3Blue1Brown; it's a nice and completely free resource

## Simulators

* [Neural Network Simulator](https://www.mladdict.com/neural-network-simulator)
  * this will be great for testing, attempting to implement
  * shows each step and has a verifiable check 
    * therefore tests can be made for each step

## Videos

* [3Blue1Brown's Video Series on Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
  * this video does a great job explaining what is going on in a Neural Network at a higher level
  * help build an intuition of what happens

* [Welch Labs Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU)

## Blog Posts

* [Step by Step Math](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/)
