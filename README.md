# Neural Net Toy

I decided to mess around with an online [Neural Network Simulator](https://www.mladdict.com/neural-network-simulator) to try to better understand how they work and the math behind them. I built a selenium script that ran the Neural Network Simulator to collect data about a simple neural network and each step it took. I then used this data to test a simple Neural Network I created in python using Numpy for calculations of each layer. 

To see the code of my simple Neural Network and web scraping, click the Google Colab link below. Or simple click the `Toy Neural Network.ipynb` file to see a static version of the Jupyter Notebook.
